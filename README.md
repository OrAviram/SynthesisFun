After being released from army I found myself with free time, which means I finally returned to doing fun things.

I started going to EDM events, after being interested in EDM music for a while. That kinda got me excited about making music again.

In the process of learning how to make music I started learning about how synthesizers work, and as much as the theory is fun, I think the best way to learn how synthesizers work is to try to make a primitive one myself.

I am using two main sources to learn synthesis:

Because I have no idea how to program sound related things, I am also using javidx9's series on programming a synthesizer.

This is obviously not going to turn out to be a good synthesizer, but just a weird attempt at learning how they work. I'm not sure why I'm even making this public.
